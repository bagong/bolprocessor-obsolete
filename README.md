# Bol Processor
Bernard Bel and Anthony Kozar are working towards a new Bolprocessor version - likely to be called Bolprocessor 3 (bp3) - that combines a command-line app and a php-based web-interface. The last released version 2.9.8 is a Carbon based 32-bit application and cannot be run on MacOS Catalina any more. The new version runs on MacOS, Linux (incl. Raspbian/ARM) and Windows (MSYS2/MinGW build). The console app development is pushed to the Sourceforge git-repo, this repo just mirrors it casually and adds snapshots of the php-interface as they become available. New snapshots are anounced on the Bolprocessor developer mailing-list, and can be downloaded via a link on the Bolprocessor site (https://bolprocessor.org/misc/BP3/CheckList.html)
